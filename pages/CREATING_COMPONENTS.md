# Creating RADiQL Components

The process of creating a RADiQL component begins by defining its 
interfaces. The interfaces of a RADiQL component are the message 
types that it can consume or emit. It's therefore fundamental to
create these message types first.

The message types that are used to define an interface will often
already have been defined and will be published in a Git repository.
