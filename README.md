# About RADiQL

RADiQL is a toolset that combines Rapid Application Development with 
Flow Based Programming, Stream Processing, Microservices and GraphQL.
RADiQL builds upon NodeJS, React, Akka, Kafka and Apollo Client and 
Server. RADiQL incorporates the principles of Clean Architecture - as 
promoted by Robert C Martin ("Uncle Bob") and incorporates the concept
of Use Cases being implemented by Interactor components. 

RADiQL merges the concepts of Flow Based Programming, Clean Architecture, 
Use Case Interactors and the Actor model. These make a suprisingly good 
fit and demonstrate high levels of synergy. The user interface and data 
persistence mechanisms are treated as plugins, as per Clean Architecture.

The principles of Flow Based Programming (FBP) are used in association
with a form building tool to provide rapid development of data processing
and enterprise integration. GraphQL is used to provide boundary interfaces
for browser-based forms and native form apps.

RADiQL is designed for easy deployment into a cloud using Docker, Kubernetes 
and a distributed data centre operating system such as Mesosphere DC/OS.
